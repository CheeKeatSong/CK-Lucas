* ****. With just a snapshot on the receipt, Aodit will store your expenses!

* **User friendly**. You will need zero guidance to use it. The UX/UI is designed to be interactive.

* **The big picture**. The expenses record will be computed into a statistic for visualisation based on daily, weekly, monthly or even weekly scale. Therefore, gives you the clear overview of your personal expenses.
 
* **In-app-currency**. For every new receipt scanned, you get points!

* **In-app-store**. More points you accumulate, more coupons for you. The store allows you to exchange dining coupon with points to save even more.
